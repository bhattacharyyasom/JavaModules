### Java Modules in the raw
This code base has a basic skeleton of an application inspired from this excellent talk by Venkat Subramanium .

Ref : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DItYExUOPeM

This example does not use any build tool or IDE specific tools to make sure we try and understand java modules at its lowest level possible.

The code inside the `service` folder depends on code inside `data` folder.
We create a `jar` for each in the old way, and the new "modularised" way and see the differences.

Below instructions can be followed to follow along and learn the bare bones of java modules

###### Compiling and running "old jars" on classpath
* The `build_classpath.sh` has the sequence of the commands to compile and run in the old way

###### Compile "old jars" and run on module path 
* At the end of the `build_classpath.sh` file there is a commented out command that can be used to see what would happen if we ran these old style jars on the module path
* Also, because old jars on module path are treated as `Automatic` modules 


###### Compile and run "modularized jars" on module path
* The `build_mods.sh` has the sequence of the commands to compile and run the same code in the "new" way
